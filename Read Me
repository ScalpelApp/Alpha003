This is the current working version - Built in Unity 2017.2 - This is required to support Vuforia.

I am currently working to update this version with Watson - The SDK is currently included in the Assets folder of this app.

There is a "using IBM" error with Visual Studio - I am working to resolve this and get Watson online
